This is a collection of simple single page web applications made with Reactjs, redux and react-router-v4.
Currently react-router is not listed in dependancies becasue v4 is still alfa.
Clone v4 branch, use "npm run build" on that repo clone, and than use "npm link path/to/router-repo-clone"
inside this repo.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The most recent version of Create React App guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
